### Introduction
In today's digital age, the job market has expanded significantly, with platforms like LinkedIn and Naukri offering countless opportunities for job seekers. However, alongside these legitimate job postings, there has been a troubling rise in fraudulent job listings designed to exploit unsuspecting applicants. These fake job posts can lead to financial loss, identity theft, and emotional distress for job seekers, making it crucial to identify and analyze these scams.

The Fake Job Post Prediction project aims to address this pressing issue by developing a robust system to identify and flag potentially fraudulent job postings. By leveraging advanced analytical techniques and machine learning algorithms, we will analyze various characteristics of job posts—such as language patterns, company credibility, and posting frequency—to differentiate between genuine and fake opportunities.

Our goal is to create a reliable tool that empowers job seekers with the information they need to make informed decisions, thereby enhancing their job search experience and safeguarding them from scams. By shedding light on the dark side of online job hunting, we hope to contribute to a safer and more transparent job market for everyone.
